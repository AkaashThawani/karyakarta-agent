in the recipe card at the bottom of this post. Use the table of contents (back at the top, below the first image, to navigate).Chocolate Chips –Use chocolate chips, chopped chocolate bars, or chocolate chunks! You can even use milk chocolate chips if you like, but I think semi-sweet keeps things from becoming too sweet.Chopped Chocolate– I use a combination of both unsweetened chocolate and a mix of milk, semi-sweet, and dark chocolate. This makes the cookies sweet and rich without being *too* sweet.Butter –I always use salted butter for the best flavor, but feel free to use unsalted butter if you prefer.Granulated Sugar –Using all granulated sugar helps keep this cookie from spreading too much in the oven.Eggs –Use large eggs, at room temperature.Vanilla Extract –Use real vanilla extract for the best flavor.All-purpose Flour –Spoon your flour into the measuring cup, then level it with a flat utensil for best results, or use a scale. Scooping the measuring cup directly into your flour will lead to too much flour, and a potentially dry bake.Cocoa Powder –I like using dutch process cocoa powder with melted chocolate for extra depth of chocolate flavor!Recipe Variations:Gluten-free –Simply swap almond flour in the same quantity as all-purpose flour to make these cookies gluten-free! I use the same base recipe for myPeanut Butter Chip Chocolate Cookies, too!Dairy-free –Use your favorite plant-based butter (use baking sticks, not margarine) and dairy-free chocolate.Chocolate –I use all kinds of different types chocolate in this recipe including semi-sweet, milk chocolate, and dark chocolate. But feel free to use only one or two of your favorites or even sub out some of the chocolate chunk mix-ins for white chocolate chips, if you prefer. You can also use bittersweet chocolate in place of unsweetened in the cookie base for a slightly sweeter, less dark chocolate cookie.How to Make Triple Chocolate Chunk Cookies:Step 1: Make the Cookie Dough.Add semi sweet chocolate chips, unsweetened chocolate, & butter to a microwave safe bowl & heat in 30 second intervals, stirring between each, until fully melted and smooth. The mixture will be thick! Set aside to cool slightly.In a medium mixing bowl, beat your sugar and eggs together for about 2 minutes, until frothy. Stir vanilla and the chocolate mixture into the bowl of eggs and sugar.Add the flour, cocoa, baking soda, and salt and mix until just combined, scraping down the sides of the bowl. The mixture will seem almost like a thick brownie batter. That’s normal!Step 2: Chop your Chocolate Chunks.Chop a mixture of your three favorite types of chocolate, then mix them into the thick batter.Step 3: Chill Dough.Chill the dough for 1 hour in the fridge or 30 minutes in the freezer.Step 4:Form & Bake Cookies.Preheat the oven and line your baking sheets with parchment paper. Roll the dough into generous tablespoon-size balls. Place them about 2 inches apart, so you have 6-8 cookies per baking sheet.Serving + StoringSprinkle some flaky sea salt on top, and devour these while they’re still warm and gooey from the oven!Store leftovers in an airtight container at room temp for about a week. I like popping a leftover cookie in the microwave for 6-8 seconds before eating to get it warm and gooey again (cold cookies are just wrong, hah!).Expert Baking Tips:Oven Thermometer– Anoven thermometerwill tell you if your oven is actually running at the temperature you set it to. Your oven may not be accurate. Accurate oven temperature is crucial for most bakes, so I leave an oven thermometer in at all times to keep an eye on my oven’s calibration.Kitchen Scale –Afood scaleis the best way to make sure your flour is at the proper weight, since amounts will vary SO widely based on how you measure it, as well as the measuring cup you use, as they are not standardized.Chill the Dough –Pop the entire bowl of cookie dough into the fridge or freezer to make scooping super easy. This also helps keep the cookies from spreading and melting in the oven.Don’t Over-Bake –The triple chocolate chunk cookies will look slightly underdone when they are in fact perfectly baked. They’ll continue to cook and firm up a bit once they are removed from the oven and cool on the baking sheets.FAQs:Can you freeze cookie dough?Yes. Chill dough for 20-30 minutes so it’s easier to scoop. Then scoop dough balls and place them on a lined baking sheet. Freeze until solid, then transfer to an airtight bag or container. Freeze up to 2 months, then bake from frozen (adding 1-2 minutes) whenever a cookie craving attacks!Can I double or halve this recipe?Yes, you can. Make the dough in a very large mixing bowl for double the cookies. You can also halve the recipe.Special Tools:Electric Mixer –An electric hand mixer makes beating the eggs and sugar easy, and gets the mixture perfectly light and frothy. (I love thiscordless mixer!)Cookie Sheet –For best results use twocookie sheetsto bake the cookies 6 at a time so they aren’t all crowded onto one sheet.More Chocolate Cookie Recipes to Love:Bakery-Style Chocolate Peanut Butter CookiesS’mores Cookies (Marshmallow Stuffed)Chocolate White Chocolate Chip CookiesBrown Butter Chocolate Chip CookiesDouble Stuffed Nutella CookiesDid you make this recipe?

Scoop cookie dough balls 95 grams in size (you can make them smaller if you like!). Chill the cookie dough balls for 20 minutes or up to 2 days in an airtight container in the fridge.

Do not over bake these!When the cookies come out of the oven, immediately place a round cutter around the outside of each cookie and swirl the cookie within it to \"scoot\" them into perfect circles.
